# Part 4. Epidemiology Unit Data {.unnumbered}

## What is epidemiological data?
Epidemiological data refers to information collected and analyzed to understand the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in populations. This data is critical to the operations of Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) as it helps various units within the department in identifying risk factors for diseases, targeting prevention efforts, and guiding healthcare policies. The Epidemiology Unit is primarily concerned with chronic disease and social determinants of health, whereas Information related to the occurrence, spread, and control of infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19) within suburban Cook County is monitored and reported by CCDPH's Communicable Disease Unit.

Epidemiological data tend to communicate the incidence (i.e., The number of new cases that develop in a population over a specific time period) and prevalence (i.e., The total number of existing cases in a population over a specified period) of health outcomes, behaviors, and risk factors within a population and across population subgroups (e.g., by race/ethnicity, sex, and age).

## What types of data are used by the Epidemiology Unit?
The data used by the Epidemiology Unit are gathered through both [primary](https://justenvirons.org/epihandbook/primary_data.html) (e.g., surveys administered by the department) and [secondary](https://justenvirons.org/epihandbook/secondary_data.html) (e.g., information collected by external entities) data collection. Epidemiological data are collected at different cadences, depending on program funding and data availability.  @fig-epidatacategories presents the key types of epidemiological data reported by the Epidemiology Unit:

-   *Health surveys (primary data)*:  Surveys of SCC youths (e.g., Youth Risk Behavioral Survey) and adults (e.g., Cook County Health Survey) concerning their self-reported health status, health care access and health behaviors.
-   *Vital statistics (secondary data)*: Line (i.e., patient-) level mortality and natality records of residents within CCDPHâ€™s jurisdiction.
-   *Hospitalization (secondary data)*: Inpatient and outpatient hospital discharge records of CCDPH residents.
-   *Emergency Management System (secondary data)*:  Information collected, processed, and used by organizations involved in managing emergency situations. This data supports the preparation for, response to, recovery from, and mitigation of emergencies such as natural disasters, public health crises, accidents, or terrorist attacks. The goal is to ensure timely, effective, and coordinated actions in emergencies.
-   *Social Ecological (secondary and tertiary data)*: Socioeconomic, environmental, other data and indices used to evaluate neighborhood context and social determinants of health.
