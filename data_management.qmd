# Part 3. Data Management

Data management is an important asset in developing public health projects. Recently, many institutions and organizations have been developing data management tool-kits and plans in order to sustain their work and reproducibility. The following @fig-data-lifecycle shows the data life cycle, its sections, and subsections [@Harvard2023].

Data management involves organizing, storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in a way that allows efficient and effective use of the data. It includes tasks such as creating and maintaining databases, cleaning and preparing data for analysis, transforming data formats, and ensuring data quality and integrity. Effective data management is essential for accurate and reliable analysis results, as well as for efficient collaboration and sharing of data both within CCDPH and externally.

There are seven main steps in a what appears to be a cycle:

1- [Plan & Design / Collect & Create](dm_plan_collect.qmd)

3- [Analyze & Collaborate / Store & Manage](dm_analyze_store.qmd)

5- [Evaluate & Archive / Share & Disseminate](dm_evaluate_share.qmd)

7- [Access & Reuse](dm_access.qmd)

### Purpose

To ensure that data used in projects conducted by the Epidemiology Unit will be identifiable, accessible, and documented for deposit, sharing, and reuse.

### Areas Affected

All projects the Epidemiology Unit is involved in and/or going to conduct or develop. Also including short-term Projects that are deemed to be completed within 3 months, survey development, batch analysis, and map creation. This also includes internal and external data requests.

## Policies and Procedures

::: panel-tabset
### Epidemiology Unit Policies

The CDC developed and/or adopted multiple policies and standard operating procedures to guide Public Health Data Sharing, Archiving, and Destruction  and Project Management and Planning. The purpose of these policies to ensure the security of personal information, appropriate data communication with the public, and appropriate project management. The CDC has been committed to data modernization in order to maintain the proper development of policies simultaneously with modern technological innovation [@CDCmodern2022] . In addition, the HHS has developed many policies and procedures to help organizations build Information Technology Infrastructure [@HHSIT2021]. The policies listed in are the most relevant to the Epidemiology Unit scope of work.

IDPH is dedicated to the health and disease prevention of Illinois State residents. The majority of *policies* or *Rules* listed by IDPH on the official website are not directly related to **Data Governance**. IDPH has listed general acts and/or federal (or State) laws that pertain to requesting data from the department by the public or external stakeholders. The IDPH Records have many policies that govern accessibility (*as shown in the resources section*) [@IDPH2023]. 

The CCDPH serves Suburban Cook County with an estimated population over 2.5 million. The Epidemiology Unit has developed an **Epidemiology Unit Data Use Policies and Procedures Manual** to govern data security, collection, archiving and sharing with the public and both internal and external stakeholders. To reconcile the analysis and reporting functions of the Epidemiology Unit with the wider needs for data privacy and confidentiality by highlighting best practices for reporting public health data.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Before initiating any project and/or program, it is important to identify the **Roles & Responsibilities** of the member(s) that are going to be involved in project's / program's activities. Early identification of program's roles & responsibilities has several benefits such as *Accountability*, *Efficiency*, *Improved Planning*, *Enhanced Team Work*, *Risk Mitigation*, etc. [@indeed_roles2023; @Rose2021] 

::: panel-tabset
### Purpose

To ensure high quality data stewardship by clearly defining and assigning roles and responsibilities early in the data management plan.

### Process

-   Identify members of the Unit that are involved in or can assist in the project according to their skills and needs of the project.

-   Identify areas of workforce development and necessary training.

-   Monitoring activities of the project and roles of the members involved.

-   Review the Epidemiology Unit's organizational chart.
