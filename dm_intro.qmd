## Background

Data management is an important asset in developing public health projects. Recently, many institutions and organizations have been developing data management tool-kits and plans in order to sustain their work and reproducibility. The following figure shows the data life cycle, its sections, and subsections [@Harvard2023].

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Figure 1: Data Life Cycle'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lifecyclewheel.png')
```

There are seven main steps in a what appears to be a cycle:

1- Plan & Design

2- Collect & Create

3- Analyze & Collaborate

4- Store & Manage

5- Evaluate & Archive

6- Share & Disseminate

7- Access & Reuse

### Purpose

To ensure that data used in projects conducted by the Epidemiology Unit will be identifiable, accessible, and documented for deposit, sharing, and reuse.

### Areas Affected

All projects the Epidemiology Unit is involved in and/or going to conduct or develop. Also including short-term Projects that are deemed to be completed within 3 months, survey development, batch analysis, and map creation. This also includes internal and external data requests.

## Policies {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### HHS & CDC Policies

#### Purpose

The CDC developed and/or adopted multiple policies and standard operating procedures to guide Public Health Data Sharing, Archiving, and Destruction  and Project Management and Planning. The purpose of these policies to ensure the security of personal information, appropriate data communication with the public, and appropriate project management. The CDC has been committed to data modernization in order to maintain the proper development of policies simultaneously with modern technological innovation [@CDCmodern2022] . In addition, the HHS has developed many policies and procedures to help organizations build Information Technology Infrastructure [@HHSIT2021]. The policies listed in are the most relevant to the Epidemiology Unit scope of work.

### Epidemiology Unit Policies

#### Purpose

The CCDPH serves Suburban Cook County with an estimated population over 2.5 million. The Epi Unit has developed a **Data Suppression Policy** to govern data release and sharing process to the public. Since some data published might contain **Protected Health Information** (PHI), certain security precautions needed to be taken. 

#### Data Suppression Policy

Refer to [Data Suppression Policy](policies/DataSuppressionDraft_20220915.pdf).

##### Purpose

To reconcile the analysis and reporting functions of CCDPH and the Epidemiology Unit with the wider needs for data privacy and confidentiality by highlighting best practices for reporting CCDPH and the Epidemiology Unit data.

##### Process

The following checklists are brief descriptions of the guidelines that should be implemented when applying the suppression policy.

##### Forms and Procedures

-   [General Suppression Guidelines](products/general_suppression_guide.pdf)

-   [Tabular Data Reporting Best Practices](products/tabular_data_guide.pdf)

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Purpose

To ensure high quality data stewardship by clearly defining and assigning roles and responsibilities early in the data management plan.

### Process

-   Identify members of the Unit that are involved in or can assist in the project according to their skills and needs of the project.

-   Identify areas of workforce development and necessary training.

-   Monitoring activities of the project and roles of the members involved.

-   Review the Epidemiology Unit's organizational chart.
