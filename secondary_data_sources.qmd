# Secondary Data
Secondary data refers to data that has been collected by someone else and is therefore not originally generated by the researcher for a specific study. This data can include published studies, government reports, datasets available online, and other sources. Researchers can use secondary data to answer research questions, test hypotheses, or explore patterns and relationships in the data.
