# Part 5. Documents
The Epidemiology Unit creates different types of documents that vary in terms of purpose (e.g., analysis; awareness; prevention), audience (i.e., reading level), size/format, frequency, and dissemination platform. Documents should generally aim to: (1) utilize the latest datasets and indicators in order to convey timely information to stakeholders and bring attention to the Unit's recent data management efforts; and (2) speak to contemporary and emerging public health topics that are especially relevant to CCDPH leadership, units, elected officials, and other stakeholders. A summary of each type of document and their respective characteristics follows. Refer to the associated chapter for more in-depth document-specific information and resources.

## Epi Insights
Insights are relatively short, 1 to 2 page documents that summarize information on a single concept and are written at the 8th grade (or below) reading level to enable communication across a broad audience. Epi Insights typically include 2 to 3 interactive  figures (i.e., derived from tables, maps, and/or charts on the atlas) and are published monthly on the Cook County Health Atlas. These documents communicate public health recommendations and/or prevention programs that have been vetted through a systematic literature review, by public health professionals and partners. Development of an Epidemiology Insights document requires a thorough understanding of the topic, collaboration with experts, and a commitment to promoting evidence-based public health practices. 

## Epi Surveillance Briefs
Surveillance briefs are concise, 5 to 10 page summaries of key findings and trends derived from analyses of public health surveillance data. These briefs provide important information to public health professionals, policymakers, and researchers, helping them understand the spread of diseases, identify risk factors, and develop effective interventions. These briefs are written at the 8th grade (or below) reading level to enable communication across a broad audience. They typically include 3 to 5 figures and are published quarterly in multiple formats (i.e., both interactive HTML and static PDF) on the CCDPH web pages. Surveillance briefs serve as important tools for evidence-based decision-making, policy formulation, and resource allocation in public health. They provide concise, actionable information to stakeholders involved in disease prevention, control, and health promotion efforts.

## Epi Special Reports
Epidemiology special reports are longer, 10 to 20 page explorations into one or more related public health topics derived from analyses of public health surveillance data. They dive deeper into a health topic or condition and typically involve a brief introduction and methodology as well as a detailed quantitative and/or qualitative analysis with a summary of major findings. These reports are written at the 8th grade (or below) reading level to enable communication across a broad audience. They typically include 5 to 10 figures and are published in multiple formats (i.e., interactive HTML and static PDF) on the CCDPH web pages. Similar to Epi Surveillance Briefs, these reports should help inform decision-making, policy formulation, and resource allocation in public health and serve as actionable information to stakeholders involved in disease prevention, control, and health promotion efforts.

## Journal manuscripts
CCDPH's Epidemiology Unit is in a unique position to both independently and, through collaboration with academic partners, engage in scholarly epidemiological and public health research that can be shared via scientific journals. The purpose of the journal manuscripts is to communicate new findings, ideas, methodologies, or analyses to the broader epidemiology community and to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in public health. While the size, format, and structure of manuscripts vary by journal, typical manuscripts have several key components including a title, abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion, and references. Manuscripts submitted by the Epidemiology Unit to academic journals also undergo a peer-review process, where other experts in the field evaluate the quality, validity, and significance of the research before it is accepted for publication. Given the time intensive nature of producing such manuscripts, approval from CCDPH leadership is needed prior to commencing any research activities.

## Posters
The Epidemiology Unit regularly present posters at regional and national public health conferences or symposium, including the CSTE, Illinois Public Health Association (IPHA), and American Public Health Association (APHA) annual conferences. These large format (e.g., 4'x 8'), hard copy conference posters are typically displayed on boards or stands in a designated poster session of a conference and provide a way for staff to share a condensed overview of recent research, projects, or ideas with a larger audience. Similar to journal manuscripts, conference posters typically include some standard components, including a title, author names, introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusion, and references.

## Presentations and slide decks
The Epidemiology Unit prepares presentations and slide decks to communicate public health information and unit activities to internal employees and a wide range of external stakeholders. These slide decks typically follow a standard CCH template.
