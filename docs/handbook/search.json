Administered in 2010 and 2020 with plans to administer every two years going forward, the survey assesses health risk behaviors among students (grade 9-12) in participating high schools throughout suburban Cook County. The survey is used to monitor and evaluate a variety of health-related behaviors and conditions among adolescents, including physical activity, sexual behavior, nutrition, alcohol and drug use, and mental health. Survey results can be used to inform the development of health policies and programs that address the needs of adolescents. The Epidemiology Unit carried out this survey in 2020 and 2022 and, as of spring 2023, has plans to administer the survey on an annual basis.\n\n\nCook County Health Survey\nThe Cook County Health Survey (CCHS) is a cross-sectional survey with a sample of approximately 32,000 randomly selected adults aged 18 and older suburban Cook County residents. The paper and web-based versions of the survey are available in English and Spanish. All data collected are self-reported and used to help the CCDPH assess the health-related needs of the county population and to guide the Department in planning programs to improve the health and well being of county residents. The design of the survey including question phrasing and structure closely follows CDC’s national Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the Illinois County Behavioral Risk Factor Surveys (ICBRFS) programs. The CCDPH has traditionally sought to align its survey with validated questions asked in the BRFSS, ICBRFS, as well as the similarly structured Healthy Chicago Survey (HCS) via a broader collaborative effort with the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)."

    "section": "15.5 CCDPH SQL Server",
    "text": "15.5 CCDPH SQL Server\nSQL Server refers to a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It is designed to store and manage large amounts of data and is used by organizations of all sizes for a wide range of applications. SQL Server supports the Structured Query Language (SQL), which is a standard language used to manage relational databases. SQL Server provides a wide range of features and services, including: (1) Data storage and management: SQL Server provides efficient storage and retrieval of data, allowing for quick access to large amounts of data: (2) Security: SQL Server provides robust security features, including authentication, authorization, and encryption, to protect data from unauthorized access; (3) Integration with other Microsoft technologies: SQL Server integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft technologies such as Excel, OneDrive, and SharePoint. (Trick et al. 2021)\nThe CCDPH SQL Server was established by the Health Information Services (HIS) Department server in summer 2022 at the request of the Communicable Disease and Epidemiology Units as part of an effort to centralize and coordinate efficient and secure data storage and sharing within and between the units. The CCDPH SQL Server includes patient-level vital statistics, hospital discharge, communicable disease cases and other data used by CCDPH epidemiologists in their surveillance activities. Information stored on the server change regularly as databases and tables are created and modified.\nThe CCDPH SQL Server is HIPAA-compliant and therefore can securely store PHI. And while data stored on the server are archived regularly, it is not a cloud service and does not readily support versioning.\nOnly select CD and Epi unit employees and interns have access to information stored on the CCDPH SQL Server. Permissions to read and/or edit data objects on the server are set by data owners and are limited to staff who have Windows authenticated access to the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) network domain (i.e., staff who have a CCHHS user name and password). Third parties outside of CCHHS do not have access to the service. Access to the service, databases, tables and particular table columns are granted to employees on a must-need basis. The server name are shared with staff upon access approval. Data are managed by designated data owners and editors.\nThe first step to gaining access to the server is to send an email request to a data owner. CD staff should request access from Kelley Bemis (Program Manager) and Epidemiology Unit staff should request access from Scott Smith (Project Coordinator). The email should specify the particular datasets needed (e.g., death certificate records). The data owner will respond with the server name and names of databases, tables, and/or columns to which the requester has been granted access.\nThe type of contents stored in SQL Server database tables are identified by schema. The schema that tables belong to are noted using a standard prefix.\n\ndbo = default “database owner” schema for raw, uncleaned datasets. used exclusively by db owners (contains phi)\nphi = “protected health information” schema used for cleaned datasets (contains phi)\nepi = non-suppressed aggregated “epidemiology” data (does not contain phi)\nsup = aggregated and “suppressed” data that can be disseminated more broadly (does not contain phi)\n\nUsers may access server data via different platforms. Instructions for access via select protocols are provided below.\n\n15.5.1 R via DBI package\nTo protect server security, it is advised that R users encrypt the server name using the keyring package. For example, the below code key_set(“ccdph_sql_server”) will prompt the user to type in and “set” the server name in keyring. Once set, the user may access the encrypted key using the command, key_get(“ccdph_sql_server”).\n\n# activate keyring package\nlibrary(keyring)\n\n# set server name \"password\" as \"ccdph_sql_server\"\n# when prompted type in/copy protected server name \"password\" into dialog box \nkey_set(\"ccdph_sql_server\")\n\n# retrieve/get server name in code\nkey_get(\"ccdph_sql_server\")\n\nUse the following code to connect to the server using stored keyring password/secret. Databases and tables to which you have been granted access will appear in the RStudio Connections tab. Refer to instructions in subsequent sections in this document to go about importing, exporting, and editing objects on the server.\n\n# activate packages\nlibrary(keyring)\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(dbplyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(odbc)\n\n# connect to server\ncon_ccdph_sql_server <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),\n                        Driver   = \"SQL Server\",\n                        Server   = key_get(\"ccdph_sql_server\"))\n\n# connect to database\ncon_epi_database <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),\n                        Driver   = \"SQL Server\",\n                        Server   = key_get(\"ccdph_sql_server\"),\n                        Database = \"database-name\")\n\n# execute SQL code/script on server\n# execute from SQL file\ndbExecute(conn = con_epi_database, \n          statement =  read_file(\"file/path/name.sql\"))\n\n# executive SQL from character string\ndbExecute(conn = con_epi_database, \n          statement =  \"SELECT TOP 10 * INTO [schema_name].[table_name] FROM [schema_name].[table_name] \")\n\n# import/read table from server\n# execute using dbGetQuery\nimported_data <- dbGetQuery(conn = con_epi_database,\n                            statement =  \"SELECT TOP 10 * FROM [schema_name].[table_name]\")\n\n# execute using dbplyr\nimported_data <- con_epi_database %>%\n  tbl(in_schema(\"schema_name\",\"table_name\")) %>%\n  collect()\n\n# write R data frame to SQL Server database in specified schema\ntable_id <- DBI::Id(\n  schema = \"schema_name\",\n  table = \"table_name\"\n)\n\ndbWriteTable(conn =  con_epi_database,\n             name = table_id, \n             value = data_frame_name, \n             overwrite = TRUE,\n             append = FALSE)\n\n\n\n15.5.2 Microsoft applications via ODBC\nTo access server data using Microsoft applications, it is necessary to first install the SQL Server ODBC driver. Follow the steps below.\n\nType “ODBC Data Sources” into the Windows search prompt to open the ODBC Data Source Administrator dialog.\nClick “New” in the dialog and select “SQL Server” as the driver type.\nType in a name (e.g., “CCDPH SQL Server”) and description (“Centralized storage and management of Inter-Epi datasets”) for ODBC connection along with server name received from SQL Server data owner.\n\n\n15.5.2.1 Excel\n\nIn the “Get & Transform Data” tab, click the “Get Data” option\nChoose the “From Other Sources”, then “From ODBC” click the CCDPH SQL Server connection you created.\nFrom here, you should be able to see the databases and tables to which you have access. Double-click a table to import a copy of the data into Excel.\n\n\n\n\n15.5.3 Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio\nMicrosoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is a software application developed by Microsoft that is used for configuring, managing, and administering all components within Microsoft SQL Server. CCDPH uses the . If you don’t have the latest SQL Management Studio general availability (GA) version installed on your CCDPH machine, request installation by submitting a ticket through Cook County’s online help system.\nOnce installed, open SQL Management Studio on a laptop or tower computer that is directly connected (via LAN not WIFI) to the CCHHS network. It is possible to use a remote desktop connection to log into a computer that is lined into the CCHHS network. The tower machines at Bridgeview, for example, are connected directly to the network via LAN cables. Refer to the Epi Handbook for information concerning how to log in remotely to an office computer."

    "text": "19.2 Hospitalization\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) makes available to CCDPH inpatient and outpatient (or emergency department visits) hospital discharge data. These data can exceed many million records per year and therefore requires substantial processing prior to data analysis. The first challenge concerns classification the discharges into meaningful categories. For this, we use the primary diagnosis information for each patient. The primary diagnosis is assigned using ICD-10 categorization schema.\nThese principal diagnoses are then further aggregated into categories using four conventional systems of grouping: (1) the ICD-10-CM (Clinical Modification) system; (3) the Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) categories; (2) Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG); and (4) Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs).\n\n19.2.1 International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes\nHowever it will take time for the health care system to fully implement the new standard, which is why the Epidemiology Unit uses ICD-10-CM definitions.\n\n\n19.2.2 International Classification of Disease Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)\n\n\n19.2.3 Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) Categories\nThe Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) for ICD-10-CM Diagnoses is one in a family of databases and software tools developed as part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), a Federal-State-Industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). HCUP databases, tools, and software inform decision making at the national, State, and community levels.\nThe Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) for ICD-10-CM diagnoses aggregates more than 70,000 ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes into over 530 clinically meaningful categories. The CCSR is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). The categories are organized across 22 body systems, which generally follow the structure of the ICD-10-CM diagnosis chapters.\nThe CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses provides a means by which to identify specific clinical conditions using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. The CCSR for ICD-10-CM capitalizes on the specificity of the ICD-10-CM coding scheme by creating new clinical categories that did not exist in previous versions of the CCS tool and allowing ICD-10-CM codes to be classified in more than one category. The CCSR is intended to be used analytically to examine patterns of healthcare in terms of cost, utilization, and outcomes; rank utilization by diagnoses; and risk adjust by clinical condition.\n\n\n19.2.4 Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs)\nhttps://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/ICD-10-MS-DRG-Conversion-Project\n\n\n19.2.5 Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs)\nA three-digit numeric code that groups beneficiary diagnosis codes into broad categories based on condition type and body region."

The email should specify the particular datasets needed (e.g., death certificate records). The data owner will respond with the server name and names of databases, tables, and/or columns to which the requester has been granted access.\nUsers may access server data via different platforms. Instructions for access via select protocols are provided below.\n\n29.2.1 R via DBI package\nTo protect server security, it is advised that R users encrypt the server name using the keyring package. For example, the below code key_set(“ccdph_sql_server”) will prompt the user to type in and “set” the server name in keyring. Once set, the user may access the encrypted key using the command, key_get(“ccdph_sql_server”).\n\n# activate keyring package\nlibrary(keyring)\n\n# set server name \"password\" as \"ccdph_sql_server\"\n# when prompted type in/copy protected server name \"password\" into dialog box \nkey_set(\"ccdph_sql_server\")\n\n# retrieve/get server name in code\nkey_get(\"ccdph_sql_server\")\n\nUse the following code to connect to the server using stored keyring password/secret. Databases and tables to which you have been granted access will appear in the RStudio Connections tab. Refer to instructions in subsequent sections in this document to go about importing, exporting, and editing objects on the server.\n\ncon_ccdph_sql_server <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),\n                        Driver   = \"SQL Server\",\n                        Server   = key_get(\"ccdph_sql_server\"))\n\n\n\n29.2.2 Microsoft applications via ODBC\nTo access server data using Microsoft applications, it is necessary to first install the SQL Server ODBC driver. Follow the steps below.\n\nType “ODBC Data Sources” into the Windows search prompt to open the ODBC Data Source Administrator dialog.\nClick “New” in the dialog and select “SQL Server” as the driver type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Add SQL Server ODBC connection\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29.1:"

The latest version of the ICD, ICD-11, was adopted by the 72nd World Health Assembly in 2019 and came into effect in January 2022. This eleventh revision, which is now the standard in over 30 countries around the world, contains nearly 17,000 unique disease codes and 120,000 codable terms. Across the years, the ICD has become an important part of the US health care system as it provides standard coding for payment and medical procedures."

File storage capacity on this network is relatively large.\nAccess to the network drive is limited to CCH staff who have Windows authenticated access to the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) network domain (i.e., staff who have a CCHHS user name and password).

    "text": "16.1 Hospital discharge data\nHospital discharge data are administrative data collected when a patient is discharged from a hospital. Inpatient data is collected on patients admitted to a hospital for an overnight stay, while outpatient data is collected on patients who receive services from a hospital but do not stay overnight. The CCDPH receives both inpatient and outpatient data from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) on an irregular basis. The discharge data include patient demographic information, diagnosis codes, procedures codes, charges, among other data (see data dictionary below).\nOnce received, the Epidemiology Unit cleans, processes and creates a variety of indicators–as both frequencies or counts and age-standardized rates–of hospital discharges for select diagnoses at multiple geographic aggregations including suburban Cook County, CCDPH’s jurisdiction and by zip code. These rates are then made available on the Cook County Health Atlas and other data briefs and reports. This document walks through the process for requesting, importing, cleaning and analyzing hospitalization inpatient and outpatient discharge data.\n\n16.1.1 Request and download hospital disccharge data from IDPH\nCCDPH is not able to access hospitalization discharge data directly through an API or other dynamic means. Rather the Epidemiology Unit must request the data from a designated IDPH contact person via a formal process. The latest hospitalization data received by CCDPH (years 2010 through 2020) were acquired March 2022. The IDPH contact person at that time was Rich [Orland] Forshee, orland.forshee@illinois.gov, Data Analyst for IDPH’s Division of Patient Safety and Quality (525 W Jefferson, Floor 2 Springfield, IL 62761; phone: 217-782-6320).\nThe process begins by receiving a data use agreement (DUA) made available from IDPH which is promptly sent over to CCDPH’s legal team to review. Once both parties agree on the terms of the DUA, the Epi Unit obtains signatures from data users/handlers as well as CCDPH’s Director. Once the contract is signed by all relevant parties, it is returned to IDPH who then makes the data available for download. In March 2022, the Epidemiology Unit requested that the data be made available as a flat file in CSV format. The data, which includes protected health information (PHI), were downloaded to the Epi Unit’s network drive under a standard directory."
