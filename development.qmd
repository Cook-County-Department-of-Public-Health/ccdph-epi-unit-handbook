# Online Resources {.unnumbered}

There are many online opportunities for advancing epidemiological work. Below is a summary of professional development opportunities organized by topic.

## R statistical program

The Epidemiology Unit makes extensive use of R software for data management, including the processing and analysis of public health data. R is becoming the statistical application of choice within CCDPH in part because of its flexibility--e.g., it is widely used by epidemiologists for data manipulation, visualization, hypothesis testing, machine learning, and time series analysis--and because it has a rich ecosystem of user-contributed packages which expand the software's capabilities. The base software--which was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in the mid-1990s--is also open source, which means it is free to use, modify, and distribute.
