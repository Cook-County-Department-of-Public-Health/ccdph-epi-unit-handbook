Good afternoon. My name is Scott Smith and I work as a chronic disease and prevention epidemiologist at CCDPH.

thanks for inviting me to share a couple exciting initiatives that our unit is carrying out this summer and over the next several weeks. First is the cook county health survey and the second is the suburban cook county health atlas.

i'll begin with the cook county health survey (available on this web page https://cookcountypublichealth.org/health-survey/)

- The survey is designed to collect public health-related information for about 8,000 adult who reside within CCDPH's jurisdiction; essentially the 120 or so municipalities within suburban Cook County. Survey respondents will be asked 163 questions concerning their personal health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and access to health care. Similar to the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (BRFSS), this survey relies on self-reported health characteristics so is different from clinical, or provider data which are informed by professional diagnoses.

- Findings from the survey will help inform health policy, program development, community education initiatives, and public awareness campaigns. 

- Randomly selected residents will receive a postcard requesting their participation. The survey takes 25-30 minutes to complete, and respondents will receive a financial incentive for participating.

- quite a while now, we've relied on IDPH to collect self-reported county level health data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, health care access, and use of preventative services via the the Illinois County Behavioral Risk Factor Survey. Limitation is that these are reported at the county level.

- encouraging the development and sharing of data to inform our own department programs, policies and plans, including the mission and initiatives that Andrea outlined in the CCH strategic plan.

- this platform and the indicators are not static. metopio continues to enhance functionality. we also look to our leadership and community partners to identify ways to enhance and improve information provided on the atlas. for example, we've added a seventh category of health-related indicators  that help identify priority communities within our jurisdiction. (SVI; area deprivation index; childhood opportunity) (e.g., disproportionately impacted zip codes)

- continue to welcome feedback from partners
