# GitHub {.unnumbered}
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform that provides a collaborative environment for CCDPH employees and potentially others to work on and manage files using the [Git version control system](https://git-scm.com/). The CCDPH Epidemiology and Communicable Disease Units typically organize collaborative projects through GitHub repositories, which are essentially collections of files and their complete version histories. Each repository is associated with a project. For example, code used to create this Epidemiology Unit Employee Handbook is managed via the [ccdph-epi_unit_handbook](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-epi_unit_handbook)  GitHub repository. Repositories can be made either public or private, depending on how the information is to be shared.

## CCDPH organization GitHub account
CCDPH GitHub repositories are typically stored under the [CCDPH organization account](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health), of which [Kelley Bemis](kbemis@cookcountyhhs.org) is the owner. If you need access to the CCDPH GitHub account, email a request to Kelley at [kbemis@cookcountyhhs.org](kbemis@cookcountyhhs.org).

## Active GitHub repositories
The [complete list of CCDPH GitHub repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/repositories) represents a wide range of projects. Some projects concern dashboards (e.g., [ccdph-population-shiny](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-population-shiny)) while others pertain to datasets (e.g., [ccdph-hospital-discharge](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-hospital-discharge)) or specific documents or platforms (e.g., (nssp-opioid-report)[https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/nssp-opioid-report]). Brief summaries of repositories that are particularly relevant to the Epidemiology Unit follows. Refer to the repository-specific readme files for for up-to-date information concerning each repository.

### General use repositories
The Epidemiology and Communicable Disease Units have created a few general use repositories for storing commonly used functions, GIS shapefiles, and datasets. The content stored in these repositories are often used across projects to perform a wide range of activities. The Epidemiology Unit has also created a repository for managing code for producing written documents such as data briefs and special topics reports.

+ [ccdph-functions](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-functions): Includes a number of scripts with functions used to carry out a wide range of operations.
+ [ccdph-shapefiles](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-shapefiles): 
+ [ccdph-datasets](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-data-sets): Contains public population and "helper" data sets frequently used by the CCDPH and Epidemiology and Communicable Disease departments. Datasets are stored in this repository to facilitate both sharing and data standardization among data users.
+ [ccdph-documents](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-documents): Includes Quarto/markdown documents developed by the CCDPH's Epidemiology Unit. Documents managed via this repository include data briefs and special topics reports. The repository also includes general purpose templates for different document formats.

### Dataset-specific repositories
+ [ccdph-vital-statistics](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-vital-statistics): Used by CCDPH's Epidemiology Unit to manage code related to the processing of vital statistics data. The unit receives vital statistics (i.e., births, deaths) data on a regular basis from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) [Vital Statistics Office](https://dph.illinois.gov/data-statistics/vital-statistics.html). These statistics provide essential insights into health trends including mortality (leading causes of death) and maternal child health among residents within CCDPH's jurisdiction.
+ [ccdph-hospital-discharge](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-hospital-discharge): Includes code for the processing administrative data collected when a patient is discharged from a hospital. The CCDPH receives both [inpatient and outpatient data](https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/patient-safety-quality/discharge-data.html) from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) on an irregular basis. The discharge data include patient demographic information, diagnosis codes, procedures codes, and related charges.
+ [ccdph-cchhs](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-cchhs): Contains code for processing annual Cook County Health Survey (CCHS) data. The [Cook County Health Survey (CCHS)](https://cookcountypublichealth.org/health-survey/) is a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected adults aged 18 and older residents of suburban Cook County.

### Platform or document-specific repositories
+ [ccdph-health-atlas](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-health-atlas): Used by CCDPH's Epidemiology Unit to manage code related to the processing of data for the [Cook County Health Atlas](https://cookcountyhealthatlas.org/).
+ [ccdph-population-shiny](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-population-shiny): Manages code used for processing data for and serving up, via R Shiny, the [CCDPH Population Dashboard](https://ccdphcd.shinyapps.io/ccdph-population-shiny/).
+ [ccdph-epi-unit-handbook](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-epi-unit-handbook): Used for managing code for producing content for the [CCDPH Epidemiology Unit Handbook](https://cookcountypublichealth.org/documents/handbook).
+ [ccdph-chsa](https://github.com/Cook-County-Department-of-Public-Health/ccdph-chsa): Used for managing code for producing content for the [CCDPH Epidemiology Unit Handbook](https://cookcountypublichealth.org/documents/handbook)
