# Data Briefs {.unnumbered}

Data Briefs focus on the ongoing monitoring of a specific diseases or a health condition. Such reports provide data on disease prevalence, incidence, and distribution patterns. The CCDPH - Epidemiology Unit's *Surveillance Briefs* are concise, 5 to 10 page summaries of key findings and trends derived from analyses of public health surveillance data. These briefs provide important information to public health professionals, policymakers, and researchers, helping them understand the spread of diseases, identify risk factors, and develop effective interventions. These briefs are written at the 8th grade (or below) reading level to enable communication across a broad audience. They typically include 3 to 5 figures and are published quarterly in multiple formats (i.e., both interactive HTML and static PDF) on the CCDPH web pages. Surveillance briefs serve as important tools for evidence-based decision-making, policy formulation, and resource allocation in public health. They provide concise, actionable information to stakeholders involved in disease prevention, control, and health promotion efforts.
